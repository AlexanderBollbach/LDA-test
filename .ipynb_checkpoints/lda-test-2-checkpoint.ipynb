      "hundreds of people have been forced to vacate their homes in the southern highlands of new south wales as strong winds today pushed a huge bushfire towards the town of hill top. a new blaze near goulburn, south-west of sydney, has forced the closure of the hume highway. at about 4:00pm aedt, a marked deterioration in the weather as a storm cell moved east across the blue mountains forced authorities to make a decision to evacuate people from homes in outlying streets at hill top in the new south wales southern highlands. an estimated 500 residents have left their homes for nearby mittagong. the new south wales rural fire service says the weather conditions which caused the fire to burn in a finger formation have now eased and about 60 fire units in and around hill top are optimistic of defending all properties. as more than 100 blazes burn on new year's eve in new south wales, fire crews have been called to new fire at gunning, south of goulburn. while few details are available at this stage, fire authorities says it has closed the hume highway in both directions. meanwhile, a new fire in sydney's west is no longer threatening properties in the cranebrook area. rain has fallen in some parts of the illawarra, sydney, the hunter valley and the north coast. but the bureau of meteorology's claire richards says the rain has done little to ease any of the hundred fires still burning across the state. \"the falls have been quite isolated in those areas and generally the falls have been less than about five millimetres,\" she said. \"in some places really not significant at all, less than a millimetre, so there hasn't been much relief as far as rain is concerned. \"in fact, they've probably hampered the efforts of the firefighters more because of the wind gusts that are associated with those thunderstorms.\" \n",
      "indian security forces have shot dead eight suspected militants in a night-long encounter in southern kashmir. the shootout took place at dora village some 50 kilometers south of the kashmiri summer capital srinagar. the deaths came as pakistani police arrested more than two dozen militants from extremist groups accused of staging an attack on india's parliament. india has accused pakistan-based lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammad of carrying out the attack on december 13 at the behest of pakistani military intelligence. military tensions have soared since the raid, with both sides massing troops along their border and trading tit-for-tat diplomatic sanctions. yesterday, pakistan announced it had arrested lashkar-e-taiba chief hafiz mohammed saeed. police in karachi say it is likely more raids will be launched against the two groups as well as other militant organisations accused of targetting india. military tensions between india and pakistan have escalated to a level not seen since their 1971 war. \n",

      "argentina's political and economic crisis has deepened with the resignation of its interim president who took office just a week ago. aldolfo rodregiuez saa told a stunned nation that he could not rescue argentina because key fellow peronists would not support his default on massive foreign debt repayment or his plan for a new currency. it was only a week ago that he was promising a million new jobs to end four years of recession, days after his predecessor resigned following a series of failed rescue packages. after announcing that the senate leader, ramon puerta, would assume the presidency until congress appoints a new caretaker president, the government said he too had quit and another senior lawmaker would act in the role. fresh elections are not scheduled until march leaving whoever assumes the presidency with the daunting task of tackling argentina's worst crisis in 12 years, but this time, isolated by international lending agencies. \n",
      "six midwives have been suspended at wollongong hospital, south of sydney, for inappropriate use of nitrous oxide during work hours, on some occasions while women were in labour. the illawarra area health service says that following an investigation of unprofessional conduct, a further four midwives have been relocated to other areas within the hospital. the service's chief executive officer, tony sherbon, says no one was put at risk, because other staff not involved in the use of nitrous oxide were able to take over caring for women in labour. \"well we're very concerned and the body of midwives to the hospital - there are over 70 midwives that work in our service - are very annoyed and angry at the inappropriate behaviour of these very senior people who should know better,\" he said. \"and that's why we've take the action of suspending them and we'll consider further action next week.\" \n",

      "the united states team of monica seles and jan-michael gambill scored a decisive victory over unseeded france in their first hopman cup match at burswood dome in perth. the pair, runners-up in the $1 million dollar mixed teams event last year, both won their singles encounters to give the us an unbeatable 2-0 lead. the 28-year-old seles, currently ranked eighth, recovered from a shaky start to overpower virginie razzano, 18, who is ranked 72nd. seles had to fight hard to get home in straight sets, winning 6-3, 6-4 in 62 minutes. then the 24-year-old gambill (ranked 21st) wore down a determined arnaud clement, 24, (18th) to win 6-4, 6-4 in 91 minutes. the americans are aiming to go one better than last year when they were beaten by swiss pair martina hingis and roger federer in the final of the eight-nation contest. gambill said the win was a great way to start the tennis year. \"i got a little tentative at the end, but it was a great start to my year,\" he said. \"arnaud is a great scrapper and i am delighted to beat him, even though i am frankly a bit out of shape. \"that is one of the reasons i am here. i will be in shape by the end of the tournament. \"i just aim to keep improving in the new year, and if i do, i think i have a chance to beat anyone when i am playing well.\" gambill was pressed hard by clement before taking the first set in 47 minutes. but the american gained the ascendancy in the second set, breaking in the third and fifth games. seles said she had expected her clash with razzano to be tough. \"she was a top junior player in the world, so it was no surprise that she fought so well,\" she said. seles said she still had the hunger to strive to regain her position at the top of her sport. \"this is why you play,\" she said. \"but i want to try not to peak too early this season. \"seles, slow into her stride, slipped to 2-3 in her opening set against razzano but recovered quickly, claiming the set after snatching four games in a row. in the second set, seles broke her opponent in the opening game and completed victory with relative ease despite razzano's tenacious efforts. \n",

      "there has been welcome relief for firefighters in new south wales overnight with milder weather allowing them to strengthen containment lines around the most severe fires. but fire authorities are not getting overly optimistic as dry and hot weather is forecast to continue. the weather bureau is forecasting temperatures in the high 30s and westerly winds until at least friday, which means fire authorities are reluctant to get too excited about last night's favourable conditions. marks sullivan from the rural fire service says fire fighters are remaining on guard. \"a lot of fires that have been burning in the areas around sydney and the north coast and further south have been burning within areas that are known and are contained,\" he said. \"however, that's not to say that these fires won't pose a threat given the weather conditions that are coming up over the next few days.\" despite the caution, the rural fire service says most of the state's fires that threaten property are burning within containment lines. greater sydney is ringed by fires to the north, west and south. two of those flared overnight. one at appin in the southern highlands was quickly brought under control. another flare-up at spencer, north of the city, is not contained on its north-western flank, but is not threatening property. in the lower blue mountains west of sydney, firefighters have spent the night setting up a 20 kilometre containment line to protect communities along the great western highway from glenbrook to bulaburra. two fires burning near cessnock, west of newcastle, are still within containment lines. in the state's north, aircraft will this morning check if lightning from a large electrical storm overnight has sparked any new fires above grafton. aircraft have also been used in the shoalhaven area in the state's south to drop incendiary devices that start fire control lines in inaccessible areas. the rural fire service commissioner phil koperberg says if fire activity increases hundreds of new year's eve fireworks celebrations in new south wales will be cancelled. \n",

      "peru has entered two days of official mourning for the more than 220 people killed in a fire that's destroyed part of downtown lima. police say the fire began when a fireworks cache exploded in a shop just four blocks from peru's congress in a heritage-listed area famed for its spanish colonial-era architecture. early evening crowds buying traditional fireworks for new year's eve celebrations were trapped by the flames as they raced through surrounding markets and four-storey apartment buildings. local residents blame vendors of illegal fireworks and say the death toll was exacerbated by poor traffic control in the adjoining, narrow street where cars - themselves engulfed by fire -  trapped fleeing victims. hospitals have urged the public to donate medicine for the hundreds of burns victims. peru's president alejandro toledo has cut short his beach holiday to oversee an inquiry. \n",

      "a senior hamas official has said the radical palestinian movement has decided to stop suicide bombings against israel. he told the agence france presse news agency that hamas had taken an internal decision to end what it calls \"martyrdom operations\", but it was not going to make an official declaration. the official refused to say what tactics the radical group would use in its avowed struggle to end the israeli occupation of palestinian land, or if it would revert to grisly attacks if israel carries out more \"targeted\" killings, which have taken a heavy toll on hamas operatives. \"we can't predict anything,\" the official said. an official from palestinian leader yasser arafat's fatah movement also said there had been a meeting of various palestinian factions in the west bank on wednesday and that hamas had informed them they were halting their operations. the suicide attacks triggered a massive israeli armed response and sweeping international condemnation. the fatah official, who likewise asked to remain anonymous, said hamas had said it did not want to damage palestinian national unity by carrying on with such operations. hamas suicide bombers blew themselves up in jerusalem and haifa, in northern israel, at the beginning of this month, killing 26 people and provoking the heaviest israeli air raids against mr arafat's administration to date. israel's prime minister ariel sharon severed all ties with mr arafat last week after another hamas attack, which used gunmen and roadside explosives rather than suicide bombings. mr arafat in turn ordered the closure of dozens of hamas offices and has started arresting its militants. a senior israeli defence official was quoted by army radio on tuesday as saying hamas had shifted the focus in its guerrilla war against israel, and now  planned to attack strategic targets rather than \"soft\" ones, such as public buses or crowded shopping areas. the defence source said the focus will be on attacking strategic buildings and senior israeli officials. \n",

      "australia has beaten south africa by 246 runs in the first test at the adelaide oval. needing 375 for victory, the tourists were dismissed late in the second session on the final day for 128. glenn mcgrath and shane warne each took three wickets, while jason gillespie and brett lee picked up two apiece. warne was named man of the match. jacques kallis was the major resistance for the proteas, notching an unbeaten 65. but he was ably assisted by his number 10 and 11 batsmen, makhaya ntini and nanti hayward, who frustrated the australians for the best part of two hours. set 375 for victory and starting the day at 2 for 17, the task was made much harder when boeta dippenaar was on his way early this morning, caught at first slip by shane warne from the bowling of glenn mcgrath. two balls later neil mckenzie, top scorer in the the proteas' first innings, was out leg before wicket not playing a shot to mcgrath. lance klusener and kallis shared in a 33-run partnership, before klusener, on 18, edged gillespie to warne at first slip. mark boucher became the third duck of the innings, getting a glove to a ball down the leg-side, adam gilchrist completing gillespie's second wicket. captain shaun pollock scored 1 before he was brilliantly caught at silly point by ricky ponting, warne's second victim. claude henderson lasted just four balls after the luncheon interval before popping a catch to ponting, his fifth for the match, at silly point from warne's bowling. from there it seemed the match would be over in a matter of minutes, with ntini and hayward not expected to offer much resistance. but ntini batted for more than an hour for his four runs, sharing with kallis in the highest partnership of the innings, 38 runs. but he fell to brett lee, a swinging yorker deflecting off his pads and crashing into the stumps. hayward also proved a menace to the australians, taking more than half an hour for his 12 runs before he was caught behind from lee's bowling and the innings was over. his innings was not without incident though, a lee yorker crashing into his toes, sending him to the ground for a lengthy examination of the injury. he was out three balls later. australia is now 1-0 in the best of three series. the next test starts on boxing day at the mcg. \n",

      "israeli helicopter gunships and warplanes have swooped again on palestinian cities after the jewish state dropped a political bombshell on palestinians with a decision to cut ties with yasser arafat in rage at a deadly bus ambush. apache helicopters and f-16 fighter-bombers blasted security targets in gaza city, which had been pounded the night before in repeated air raids after palestinian militants killed 10 israelis in the west bank raid. in ramallah in the west bank, also hit by missiles less than 24 hours earlier, rocket strikes sent clouds of flames and smoke in the air over a ruined police station close to the centre of the town, which has been partly reoccupied by israeli tanks. the police station was bombed last october after a palestinian mob lynched two israeli soldiers there. large parts of ramallah were plunged into darkness after the raid. in jenin to the north, us-made apaches blasted a building of mr arafat's fatah movement, witnesses said. earlier, israeli troops shot eight palestinian children near the rafah border crossing with egypt in the southern gaza strip, killing one, palestinian  hospital officials said. israel had said it would send its forces into palestinian self-rule areas to track down militants mr arafat has failed to arrest despite huge international pressure and more than a week of repeated air strikes. late wednesday local time, following the bus ambush which killed 10 jewish settlers in the west bank, f-16s blasted security targets in gaza city, nablus and gaza international airport. apache helicopters also hit a palestinian broadcasting corporation station in ramallah, and tanks and army bulldozers moved in yesterday to plough the remains into the ground and dynamite the radio mast, a symbolic blow against mr arafat's increasingly shaky authority. israel's right-wing prime minister ariel sharon, with the backing of a security cabinet dominated by nationalists, declared mr arafat \"irrelevant\" after islamic and secular palestinian militants carried out the bus ambush. israel said mr arafat had forfeited his role as a peace partner by refusing to crack down on islamic hardliners. \"i think we are close as we've ever been to a full military confrontation between israel and the palestinian authority,\" un middle east envoy terje roed-larsen warned. \"undoubtedly if that happens this will either, in the best case, weaken the institutions of the palestinian authority so much that there will be very little central authority, or the palestinian authority will be completely crushed,\" he said. \n",

      "israeli forces have launched attacks on some of the key palestinian symbols of autonomy, including gaza international airport. the strikes come as israeli authorities announced they were stepping up military operations against yasser arafat's palestinian authority. the palestinian leadership, meanwhile, appealed for intervention from the united nations security council after israeli air strikes yesterday and accused israeli prime minister ariel sharon of declaring war on the palestinians. mr sharon's government also placed force-17, the armed group in charge of mr arafat's protection, and the tanzim military groups of his fatah faction on its list of terrorist organisations, a senior israeli official said. the decisions were taken in a five-hour marathon late-night session of the national unity government, said the official, who asked not to be named. in a series of incursions and air strikes, the israeli military targeted mr arafat's symbols of power, after holding him to account for a spate of deadly suicide bombings by palestinian islamic militants. the israeli army carried out reprisal attacks against targets in the gaza strip and west bank. israeli tanks advanced to about 500 metres from mr arafat's offices in the west bank town of ramallah, witnesses and palestinian security officials said. in the gaza strip, israeli forces penetrated the airport mr arafat uses for his travels abroad and started to churn up the only runway, a palestinian liaison official said. mr sharon, blaming mr arafat for the weekend suicide bombings that killed 25 israelis, earlier sent his airforce to blast the palestinian leader's heliport in gaza and offices in the west bank town of jenin. the radical islamic movement, hamas, claimed responsibility for the suicide attacks. shortly after apache combat helicopters struck gaza city and f-16 fighter bombers hit jenin, sharon made a hard-hitting televised address, telling israelis a \"war of terrorism\" had been foisted on the jewish state. \"in choosing to try to win political accomplishments through murder and in choosing to allow the ruthless killing of civilians, arafat has chosen the path of terrorism,\" mr sharon said. \"arafat is the greatest obstacle to peace and stability in the middle east,\" mr sharon charged. \n",

      "secretary of state colin powell says the united states believes saudi fugitive osama bin laden is in the \"southern and eastern part\" of afghanistan. mr powell says it is \"just a matter of time\" before bin laden is found and the ruling taliban defeated. appearing on the cbs \"face the nation\" program, mr powell reported on the status of the us operation in afghanistan. \"[the taliban] still hanging on in kandahar and some of the southern provinces and the mountains to the east and to the south but they are under enormous pressure,\" he said. \"it is just a matter of time before we achieve our objectives.\" mr powell says us president george w. bush does not care how long the campaign takes. \"he wants osama bin laden, he wants al qaeda ripped up and the taliban has to be totally removed from power,\"  mr powell said. \"you can be sure that we are looking [for bin laden] and we have quite a few ideas to pursue.\" the united states has a total of 1,500 to 2,000 troops on the ground in afghanistan, according to defense secretary donald rumsfeld. \"we have got 1,500 to 2,000 people,\" he said. officials had earlier announced that over 1,000 us marines are deployed near the southern city of kandahar, the last stronghold of afghanistan's ousted taliban militia. the us forces also include light infantry troops in the north. mr rumsfeld also confirmed non-us coalition forces are also on the ground. us officers in afghanistan say british, german and australian liaison officers are working with the us marines in southern afghanistan. \n",
      "a new economic report claims australia's economy is strong enough to break its close link with the united states economy and resist following it into recession. the banksa trends bulletin says australia's economy has been boosted by strong rural exports. it also says the australian share market has been more stable over recent months and has built up a stronger immunity to the threat of recession. banksa's acting managing director colin taylor, says australia is now very capable of avoiding slumping with the us as the world economy slows. \"it doesn't necessarily follow that australia will follow the patterns in the states, although normally that would be the case,\" mr taylor said. \"what we're finding at the moment is that the australian economy is quite strong, our rural sector is quite strong and the values on our stock exchange companies are also at levels which are relatively consistent.\" meanwhile, forecasting firm bis shrapnel says interest rates are set to remain low and will contribute to an economic boom in the middle of the decade. the firm has released its latest set of long-term projections. \n",
      "malaysian police have arrested a man believed to have smuggled thousands of boat people into australia. the arrest comes after a two-year investigation by the australian federal police (afp) and department of immigration. naeil ahmad abdullah, 41, was arrested in malaysia last month for allegedly transporting thousands of boat people from the middle east to indonesia and into australia. afp commissioner mick keelty says the arrest will have a significant impact on people smuggling. \"what we often forget is this is transnational crime at its best,\" he said. the afp says the arrest would not have happened without the coordinated effort of malaysian and australian authorities and believes it will lead to further arrests. \n",
      "a royal commission will begin this morning in sydney into the collapse of insurance giant hih. while the commission held an initial procedural hearing in september, today the public hearings will begin, more than eight months after the company was placed into provisional liquidation. more than one million pages of documents have already been subpoenaed from witnesses including former directors, the australian securities and investments commission (asic) and the prudential regulatory authority. the terms of reference include determining what contributed to the collapse, whether any laws were broken and whether regulations need to be changed. western australian justice neville owen heads the commission, but today it is expected to hear mainly from counsel assisting, wayne martin qc. a spokesman for the commission, john dickie, says it faces a great challenge. \"the issues are quite complex really and certainly i think it's the first one into a corporation collapse like this one,\" mr dickie said. the inquiry is expected to be finished by the end of next june. \n",

      "there is a renewed attempt to move the debate over choosing an australian head of state forward, after a conference in southern new south wales at the weekend. in corowa, delegates adopted a proposal which recommended a plebiscite to direct another constitutional convention and referendum on a republic and australian head of state. a committee will meet in about four weeks to work on the next step in the campaign. one of the proposal's developers, historian walter phillips, hopes there is a vote on an australian head of state in about five years. \"i think that in five or six years we should be pretty near if we can get this process going and carried forward. \"now we have to persuade our political leaders that it is something they should take up, that's going to be one of the problems,\" mr phillips said. \n",

      "unions and a major electricity producer will take part in government-sponsored talks this afternoon, in a bid to end a long running dispute over an enterprise bargaining agreement. the row has been running nearly two years, and has led to work bans as unions press their case. the victorian state government has called in yallourn energy and power industry unions to try and resolve the dispute, which could lead to blackouts. the yallourn power station is victoria's third biggest, producing a fifth of the state's electricity. despite in-principle support for a new enterprise bargaining agreement being reached last year, it still has not been signed off. yallourn energy takes the matter to the industrial relations commission tomorrow, seeking compulsory arbitration. victoria's industrial relations minister, monica gould, admits the dispute is frustrating. \"we want this matter resolved as soon as possible and the only way to do that is for the parties to sit around the table and negotiate an outcome,\" she said. \n",
      "rival afghan factions are deadlocked over the shape of a future government. the northern alliance has demanded a 10-day adjournment of power-sharing talks in germany, after its president burhanuddin rabbani objected to the appointment system for an interim administration. president rabbani has objected to the plans for an interim government to be drawn up by appointment as discussed in bonn, saying the interim leaders should be voted in by afghans themselves. he also says there is no real need for a sizeable international security force. president rabbani says he would prefer local afghan factions drew up their own internal security forces of around 1,000 personnel. but if the world insisted there should be an international security presence, there should be no more than 100 or 200 personnel in their security forces he says. president rabbani's objections are likely to cast doubt on his delegation's ability to commit the northern alliance to any course of action decided upon in bonn. he now threatens to undermine the very process he claims to support in the quest for a stable government in afghanistan. \n",
      "george harrison the guitarist, songwriter and film producer was widely known as the \"quiet\" beatle. as the youngest beatle, he had to be snuck in underage to venues prior to the band's phenomenal success in the early 1960s. he was responsible for some of the band's classic songs, such as taxman, here comes the sun and something. but up against the genius of paul mccartney and john lennon, his songs were hard-pressed to make it onto vinyl. resentment built up and harrison withdrew from the limelight. after the beatles broke up he found solo success in 1971, with the track my sweet lord, although he was successfully sued for plagiarism and had to pay out half-a-million-pounds in damages. always against a beatles reformation, he famously declared in 1989 that the band would reform when lennon was no longer dead. in later years he was beset by lung and throat cancer. he was lucky to survive a stabbing by an intruder in his uk home in 1999. he was known for his love of eastern mysticism, motor racing and his second wife olivia, who saved his life in the knife attack. \n",
      "virgin airline's first dawn flight between launceston and melbourne got away on time this morning, despite passengers being checked-in through a tent. virgin blue has set up a temporary marquee terminal at launceston airport after it was told by ansett administrators that it could no longer share its terminal space. virgin's deputy chief executive rob sherrard says the airline had an agreement with ansett to use the check-in facilities for its lunchtime launceston to melbourne service but this could be terminated with seven days notice. virgin was told last thursday, it would have to move out throwing into disarray the airline's plans for second daily flight to tasmania launched this morning. mr sherrard says he has not heard from the administrators since. \"basically they were unwinding the contract that we had and we certainly were not able to access the terminal for our second daily flights to launceston and of course canberra as well,\" he said. \"that meant we had to make alternative arrangements.\" \n",
      "a team of australian and israeli scientists have conducted what they believe is successful research into using human embryo cells to repair brain damage. but their findings have been released just days after us president george w bush criticised similar research by a team of americans. earlier this week massachusetts based company advance cell technologies said it had successfully cloned an early stage human embryo. the announcement sparked recriminations from us congressmen with president bush saying he was 100 per cent against any type of human cloning. now an australian-israeli team has used excess ivf embryos to create precursor brain cells which they injected into the brains of baby mice. the findings show the brain cells grew to be indistinguishable from other brain tissue. while the research could prove useful in treating a variety of conditions including parkinson's disease, it is likely to come under fire from human rights groups as it involves the destruction of human embryos. \n",
